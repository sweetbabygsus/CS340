#Animal Shelter Dashboard

This Jupyter Notebook project contains a ipynb file and .py file that creates a dashboard that allows users to visualize and interact with the data uploaded through and read through mongoDB.  

Getting Started

Once you have successfully uploaded the data in mongoDB and have executed the CrudAnimalShelter appropriately you will be able to run the Dashboard .ipynb file.  This will execute a live server that displays a visual representation of the data.  
 
Prerequisites

In order to be able to run the following files you must have the following requirments.
•	Python
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	mongoDB 
While also installing the following packages.
•	pip install dash pandas plotly dash_leaflet

Installation

 Download the files in this repository to your machine.  Start your jupyter notebook and upload downloaded files.  Open the project dashbaord file and run to execute the dashboard code.  

Usage

Once the ipynb file of the dashboard is running, you will be to utilize the dashboard on a live server.  With this, you can filter through the Animal shelter data based on your needs.  

Features

Certain features provided to the user of the dashboard allow them to filter through data with two separate visualizations.  The dashboard itself and an additional chart are displayed.  While also having different widgets to sort through the data.  


# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing a program that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is done by following as much of standard industry practices.  While also following industry practices, we need to make sure that proper in-line comments are added to properly explain commands in order for reusability.  The CRUD python module is able to be reused with different databases as the code is created to be reused with the import of DB into CRUD code.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My main approach was to create the main objective of the prompt.  The initial prompt was to create one visual representation of the data on a dashboard.  Understanding what is required is essential in order to be able to build upon it.  Then designing what the dashboard will look like after adding the widgets and logo.  Then being able to add each widget one at a time end executing without error before moving on to the next widget.    

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?

 Computer scientists are able to create solutions for business companies.  Computer scientists can solve problems that a company like Grazioso Salvare has.  They are analyzing data in order to seek a certain profile in dogs to train for their search and rescue training.  When provided with an enormous amount of data to filter through in which they have no tools to sort through it in an effective way that will save time and labor, software developers are called to create solutions for these types of obstacles.  In this project, it meant creating a way to Read, Update, and even delete data for the animal database that Grazioso has.  While also creating a dashboard that helps the user analyze a visual rather than simply raw data.
